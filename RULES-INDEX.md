# Rules Index & Architecture Review

Comprehensive index of all rules, guidelines, and architectural decisions for the AI Investor Pitch Advisor project.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Microservices Architecture
**Decision**: Adopted microservices over monolithic architecture
**Rationale**:
- Independent scaling of AI/ML workloads
- Technology diversity (Python for ML, TypeScript for API)
- Fault isolation and resilience
- Team autonomy in development

**Implementation**:
```
├── Frontend (Next.js)
├── API Gateway (NestJS)
├── Parse Worker (Python/FastAPI)
├── Analysis Worker (Python/FastAPI)
├── QA Worker (Python/FastAPI)
├── Suggestions Worker (Python/FastAPI)
└── Export Worker (Python/FastAPI)
```

### 2. Event-Driven Communication
**Decision**: NATS JetStream for inter-service communication
**Rationale**:
- Loose coupling between services
- Reliable message delivery
- Horizontal scalability
- Real-time progress updates

### 3. AI/ML Pipeline Design
**Decision**: Modular pipeline with quality gates
**Rationale**:
- Independent model updates
- Quality assurance at each stage
- Fallback mechanisms for failures

### 4. Security Architecture
**Decision**: Defense in depth with zero-trust principles
**Rationale**:
- Multi-layer security controls
- Assume breach mentality
- End-to-end encryption

## Development Rules

### 1. Code Quality Standards
**Rule**: All code must pass linting and type checking
**Implementation**:
- ESLint + Prettier for TypeScript
- Black + isort + mypy for Python
- Pre-commit hooks for quality gates

### 2. Commit Message Convention
**Rule**: Conventional commits with semantic versioning
**Format**: `type(scope): description`

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

### 3. API Design Principles
**Rule**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specification
**Principles**:
- Resource-based URLs
- Consistent response format
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive error handling

## Security Guidelines

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
**Rule**: JWT-based authentication with RBAC
**Implementation**:
- Role-based access control
- Fine-grained permissions
- Secure token management

### 2. Data Protection
**Rule**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
**Implementation**:
- File encryption at rest
- Database field encryption
- Secure key management

### 3. Input Validation
**Rule**: Comprehensive input validation with sanitization
**Implementation**:
- DTOs with validation decorators
- File type validation
- Content sanitization

## Testing Standards

### 1. Test Coverage Requirements
**Rule**: Minimum 80% code coverage across all services
**Implementation**:
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for service interactions
- E2E tests for complete user journeys

### 2. Red Team Testing
**Rule**: Automated hallucination prevention testing
**Implementation**:
- Hallucination detection tests
- Answer consistency validation
- Performance benchmark tests

### 3. Performance Benchmarks
**Rule**: Established performance baselines
**Benchmarks**:
- Deck upload: <30 seconds
- Analysis completion: <45 seconds for 20 slides
- Q&A generation: <30 seconds
- Export generation: <60 seconds

## Deployment Rules

### 1. Environment Management
**Rule**: Separate environments with promotion pipeline
**Environments**: development → staging → production

### 2. Infrastructure as Code
**Rule**: All infrastructure defined as code
**Tools**: Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts

### 3. Configuration Management
**Rule**: Environment-specific configuration with secrets management
**Implementation**: Hierarchical configuration with encrypted secrets

## Monitoring & Observability

### 1. Metrics Collection
**Rule**: Comprehensive metrics for all system components
**Metrics Types**:
- HTTP request metrics
- Business metrics (uploads, analyses, etc.)
- System resource metrics
- Queue size monitoring

### 2. Logging Standards
**Rule**: Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
**Implementation**: Consistent log format across all services

### 3. Alerting Rules
**Rule**: Proactive alerting for system health
**Critical Alerts**: Error rate >5%, High latency, Low worker count

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Pre-commit
- [ ] Code passes linting and type checking
- [ ] Unit tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities (SAST scan)
- [ ] Documentation updated for new features

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] E2E tests pass on staging
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed

### Post-deployment
- [ ] Application health checks pass
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured
- [ ] Alerting rules active
- [ ] Backup verification completed
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## Emergency Procedures

### Incident Response Process
1. **Detection**: Monitoring alerts or user reports
2. **Assessment**: Impact analysis and severity classification
3. **Communication**: Internal team notification
4. **Resolution**: Implement fix or rollback
5. **Post-mortem**: Root cause analysis and prevention measures

### Rollback Strategy
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Instant rollback capability
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout with kill switches
- **Database Migrations**: Reversible schema changes
- **Version Pinning**: Exact dependency versions

## Compliance & Governance

### Data Privacy
**Rule**: GDPR and CCPA compliance for user data
**Implementation**: Data retention policies, user data deletion, consent management

### Accessibility Standards
**Rule**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
**Requirements**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast

### Documentation Standards
**Rule**: Comprehensive documentation for all features
**Types**: API docs, user guides, ADRs, deployment guides
