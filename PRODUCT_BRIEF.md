AI Investor Pitch Advisor — analyze pitch decks, suggest improvements, generate Q&A prep 

 

1) Product Description & Presentation 

One-liner 

“Upload your pitch deck and get instant AI-driven feedback on clarity, design, investor focus—plus tailored Q&A prep for meetings.” 

What it produces 

Deck analysis: slide-by-slide clarity, storytelling, design, and investor-readiness scores. 

Improvement suggestions: rewriting headlines, strengthening value prop, visual consistency tips. 

Investor-fit insights: tailoring messages for VC, angels, corporates, accelerators. 

Q&A prep kit: anticipated investor questions with model answers linked to deck content. 

Exports: annotated PDF, slide improvement report, Q&A handbook (DOCX/PDF), JSON bundle with structured feedback. 

Scope/Safety 

Tool for coaching & prep, not replacing professional advisors or legal due diligence. 

Confidential uploads with strong encryption; no data sharing outside workspace. 

All outputs link back to slides or deck sections to maintain transparency. 

 

2) Target User 

Startup founders raising pre-seed → Series B. 

Accelerator/incubator cohorts preparing demo days. 

Corporate innovation teams pitching internal ventures. 

Investor relations staff refining narratives for roadshows. 

 

3) Features & Functionalities (Extensive) 

Ingestion & Parsing 

Upload PPTX, PDF, Google Slides link → convert to text + slide images. 

OCR fallback for image-only slides. 

Extract titles, bullet points, charts, speaker notes. 

Deck Analysis 

Storyline flow: problem → solution → traction → market → team → financials → ask. 

Clarity & design: readability, jargon, density, contrast, consistency of fonts/colors. 

KPIs: TAM/SAM/SOM clarity, revenue model articulation, traction metrics. 

Investor-fit checks: stage-appropriate metrics (seed vs growth), ask sizing vs stage norms. 

Scoring system: 1–10 for clarity, design, storytelling, investor appeal. 

Suggestions & Improvements 

Rewrite slide titles as headline hooks. 

Suggest better story order or merging/reducing slides. 

Highlight weak evidence (claims without metrics). 

Recommend visual improvements (charts instead of text, brand consistency). 

Generate sample revised slides with improved content. 

Q&A Prep 

Auto-generate questions investors are likely to ask by stage/sector. 

Draft answers tied to deck content; highlight where extra detail is needed. 

Categories: market size, competition, traction, financials, valuation, exit strategy, risks. 

Confidence flags: mark weak answers needing founder prep. 

Views & Reporting 

Deck viewer: side-by-side original slides + AI annotations. 

Improvement dashboard: per-slide suggestions, priority ranking. 

Q&A trainer: flashcard mode (question → reveal model answer). 

Report exports: PDF/DOCX with annotated deck, Q&A prep doc. 

Collaboration & Governance 

Workspaces/projects (team decks). 

Reviewer comments + AI suggestions tracked separately. 

Version history of decks and feedback. 

Export logs with encrypted metadata. 

 

4) Backend Architecture (Extremely Detailed & Deployment-Ready) 

4.1 Topology 

Frontend/BFF: Next.js 14 (Vercel). Server Actions for uploads, SSR for deck viewer, ISR for shared reports. 

API Gateway: NestJS (Node 20) — REST /v1, Zod validation, RBAC, RLS, Problem+JSON. 

Workers (Python 3.11 + FastAPI control) 

parse-worker (pptx/pdf ingestion, OCR). 

nlp-worker (slide text extraction, structure detection). 

analysis-worker (clarity/design/storyline scoring). 

suggestion-worker (slide rewrites, visuals). 

qa-worker (Q&A generation, answer drafting). 

export-worker (annotated PDFs, reports). 

Event bus/queues: NATS (deck.ingest, deck.analyze, suggest.make, qa.generate, export.make) + Redis Streams. 

Datastores: 

Postgres 16 (projects, decks, slides, scores, Q&A). 

S3/R2 (deck uploads, rendered PDFs, exports). 

Redis (cache, session). 

Observability: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus/Grafana, Sentry. 

Secrets: Cloud KMS; per-deck encryption keys.
